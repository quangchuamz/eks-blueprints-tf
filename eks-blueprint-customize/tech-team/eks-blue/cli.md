```shell
kubectl describe resourcequotas -n team-platform
```
We can see the resource quotas allowed for this new namespace, and if we run:

```shell
kubectl describe limitrange -n team-platform
```
We will see the limit-range configuration that has been applied, allowing us to add default resources/limits quotas to our applications. We will see the limit-range configuration that has been applied, allowing us to add default resources/limits quotas to our applications.

There are several other resources created when you onboard a team, including a Kubernetes Service Account created for the team. This service account can also be used by our applications deployed into this namespace to inherit the IAM permissions associated with the IAM Role associated; you can see it with the special annotation eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn There are several other resources created when you onboard a team, including a Kubernetes Service Account created for the team.

We can also explore the Terraform state files generated by our apply using terraform state list and you should see resources similar to the ones shown below: We can also explore the Terraform state files generated by our apply using terraform state list and you should see resources similar to the ones shown below:
```shell
terraform state list module.eks_cluster.module.eks_blueprints_platform_teams
```
You can see in more detail in the terraform state what AWS resources were created with our team module. For example, you can see the platform team details: You can see in more detail in the terraform state what AWS resources were created with our team module. For example, you can see the platform team details:
